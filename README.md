# Ciphers
This is a collection of very basic cryptography classes. As time goes on, I will add support for more algorithms. Currently, every class is sorted into a single file, but I plan on separating them in the future for individual use.

### Currently supported algorithms ~
* Vigenere Cipher
* Caesar Cipher
* Atbash Cipher
* Polybius Cipher
